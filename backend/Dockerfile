    # Step 1: Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.11-slim

    # Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

    # Step 3: Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

    # Step 4: Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
    # We add --no-cache-dir to keep the image size smaller
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Step 5: Copy the rest of the application's code into the container
COPY . .

    # Step 6: Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8000

    # Step 7: Define the command to run the application
    # We use 0.0.0.0 to make it accessible from outside the container
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
